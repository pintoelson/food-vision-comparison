# Food Vision

This is a computer vision project. The goal is to train 4(potentially more in the future) different [models](https://food-vision-comparison.streamlit.app/#model-comparison)on the famous Food101 dataset. 
The models are [live](https://food-vision-comparison.streamlit.app/#food-vision) and ready to use.

## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The deep learning framework used
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - Web app framework in python
* [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) - An easy to use deployment service

## To-Do

* Add models with better metrics
* Implement an ensemble of weak classifiers(would result in an increase in accuracy potentially)
